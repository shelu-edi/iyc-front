        This Agenda is a plan of action for people, the planet, and prosperity. It also seeks to strengthen
        universal peace in larger freedom. We recognise that eradicating poverty in all its forms and
        dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable
        requirement for sustainable development. All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative
        partnership, will implement this plan. We are resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of
        poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet. We are determined to take the bold and
        transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path.
        As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind. The 17 Sustainable
        Development Goals and 169 targets which we are announcing today demonstrate the scale and ambition of
        this new universal Agenda. They seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals and complete what
        these did not achieve. They seek to realize the human rights of all and to achieve gender equality
        and the empowerment of all women and girls. They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three
        dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental.

        <br><br>

        The Goals and targets will stimulate action over the next fifteen years in areas of critical
        importance for humanity and the planet:

            shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.

            <br><br>

            At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all
            countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.

            <br><br>

            They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve
            health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth ‚Äì all while tackling climate change and
            working to preserve our oceans and forests.
