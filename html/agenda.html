            <p>
                This Agenda is a plan of action for people, the planet, and prosperity. It also seeks to strengthen
                universal peace in larger freedom. We recognise that eradicating poverty in all its forms and
                dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable
                requirement for sustainable development. All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative
                partnership, will implement this plan. We are resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of
                poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet. We are determined to take the bold and
                transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path.
                As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind. The 17 Sustainable
                Development Goals and 169 targets which we are announcing today demonstrate the scale and ambition of
                this new universal Agenda. They seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals and complete what
                these did not achieve. They seek to realize the human rights of all and to achieve gender equality
                and the empowerment of all women and girls. They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three
                dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental.

                <br><br>                    ​

                The Goals and targets will stimulate action over the next fifteen years in areas of critical
                importance for humanity and the planet:

                ​

                The inter linkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable Development Goals are of crucial importance
                in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realised. If we realize our ambitions across the full

                the better. </p>

        <p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a
            shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.

            <br><br>

            At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all
            countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.

            <br><br>

            They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve
            health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and
            working to preserve our oceans and forests.
