                    Enhancing Entrepreneurial Competence
                </div>
                <p>
                    Knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and behaviours that people require to successfully do a
                    specific task or activity is a reference to competence. The exposure to an entrepreneurship
                    program, in this case one that focuses on both the classroom and intense experience learning,
                    can improve one's entrepreneurial competencies.

                    <br><br>

                    The younger generation appears to improve in exhibiting certain competencies when placed in a
                    framework that focuses on experiencing and carrying out practical tasks that support
                    entrepreneurial objectives. The International Youth Council proposes to develop suitable
                    framework for the future youth generations based on the PESTEL analysis. Enhancing
                    Entrepreneurial Competence is an important focus at the IYC, as contributes towards achieving
                    and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.

                <p>
                    People of various ages and socioeconomic backgrounds need education to succeed in life. However,
                    there is growing agreement that our current educational systems fall short and that we need to
                    repurpose education and rethink the organization of learning to meet the challenges of the 21st
                    century. This is because demographic, environmental, economic, socio-political, and technological
                    changes are occurring at an accelerating rate, along with the risks and opportunities they bring.
                    Accordingly, the International Youth Council collaborates with other worldwide stakeholders to
                    uncover the flaws in the current educational systems through several studies and to provide the
                    best systems through which the youth could improve their future possibilities.

                    Our environment changes as our ways living, travelling, manufacturing and consuming goods change.
                    This includes everything from the construction of new housing and transportation infrastructure to
                    the construction of waste and water treatment facilities, the transition of technologies in the
                    energy and industrial sectors, and the adoption of more intensive agricultural practices to meet
                    societal needs. Development may result in irreversible environmental damage and serious environmental
                    issues which will compromise health, safety and quality of living beings.

                    Creating Sustainable Societies
                </div>
                <p>
                    A sustainable society is defined as a world with clean air and water, people who live in harmony
                    with the environment, consumer goods that are recycled to make new products, no use of fossil fuels,
                    and people who live and work in a connected environment. Building this society, however, is a
                    difficult task. In addition to clean, renewable fuels to replace traditional energy sources and
                    secure technology for our digital connections, it will take a radical shift in perspective to
                    prioritise this harmony. Scaling up while controlling the planet's resources to enable sustainable
                    growth will necessitate a significant shift in perspective.

                    <br><br>

                    However, maintaining and preserving peace and reconciliation among humanity, while prioritising
                    harmony through coexistence, is equally important. Accepting differences and learning to live in
                    harmony can account for an increased pace in the development and creation of sustainable societies,
                    especially in developed nations where diverse nationalities coexist.

                    <br><br>

                    The IYC aims to expose youth from rural and urban societies to advanced technologies, the
                    digitalised world and potentially innovative technical knowledge.

                    Health illustrates the wholeness of a human being, regarded as a composite of physical, emotional,
                    intellectual, social, and other parts, where the interdependence of the many parts is acknowledged

                    its effects are largely moderated by one's employment situation and social support system. Education
                    fosters physical health on both an individual and community level, and its impacts are somewhat
                    moderated by economic well-being and two measures of social well-being.

                    It is crucial that a child’s or young person's mental, social, and physical wellbeing be developed
                    in a safe, loving, supportive, and focused environment as they advance in their learning. as a
                    composite of physical, emotional, intellectual, social, and other parts, where the interdependence
                    of the many parts is acknowledged and accepted. It was discovered that education at the individual

                    well-being. This method promotes the development of respect-based relationships. The three facets
                    of wellbeing are interconnected and frequently taught as a set.

                    <br><br>

                    As a youth focused organization, the IYC has the mandate to establish action plans to promote

                    The goal of concern is to establish a society free from oppression, fear, or poverty. It's a sizable,
                    audacious, and ambitious vision, but one that we think is achievable with the right work. Our work
                    can be broadly divided into two categories: development and humanitarian aid. Although those
                    expressions may appear to be equivalent, they each serve significant purposes. Humanitarian
                    assistance aims to prevent and improve readiness for disasters brought on by natural disasters
                    and man-made crises by preserving life, reducing suffering, and upholding human dignity during and
                    after these events. The fundamental humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality,
                    and independence can also serve as guidelines for humanitarian aid.
