                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                    Competence refers to the knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and behaviors that people need to
                    perform a specific task or activity successfully. Exposure to an entrepreneurship program,
                    specifically one that emphasizes both classroom and intensive experience learning, may help an
                    individual to improve his entrepreneurial competencies. These revolve around attitudes (soft skills)
                    including perseverance, networking and self-confidence and enabling skills (hard skills) including
                    basic start up knowledge, business planning, financial literacy and managerial skills.

                    <br><br>

                    When experiencing and conducting practical tasks that support entrepreneurial goals are structured,
                    the younger generation is more advanced in exhibiting certain competencies. Based on the PESTEL
                    analysis, the International Youth Council proposes developing an appropriate framework for future
                    youth generations. Enhancing Entrepreneurial Competence is a key focus area at the International
                    Youth Council because it contributes to the achievement and implementation of the Sustainable
                    Development Goals.

                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                    People of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds require education in order to thrive in life.
                    However, there is growing consensus that our current educational systems fall short and that we
                    must repurpose education and rethink the organization of learning to cater to the challenges of
                    the 21st century. This is due to the fact that demographic, environmental, economic, sociopolitical,
                    and technological changes are accelerating, as are the risks and opportunities they bring. As a
                    result, the International Youth Council works with other global stakeholders to identify flaws
                    in current educational systems through various studies and to provide the best systems through
                    which youth can improve their future opportunities.

                    The conditions of the environment change according to changes of lifestyles, traveling,

                    transportation infrastructure to building waste and water treatment facilities, transitioning
                    technologies in the energy and industrial sectors, and adopting more intensive agricultural
                    practices to meet societal needs. Development may cause irreversible environmental damage as
                    well as serious environmental issues that jeopardize the health, safety, and quality of life of
                    living beings.

                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                    A sustainable society is referred to as one with clean air and water, people who live in harmony
                    with nature, consumer goods that are recycled to make new products, no use of fossil fuels,
                    and people who live and work in a connected environment. Building this society, on the other hand,
                    is a difficult task. In addition to clean, renewable fuels to replace traditional energy sources
                    and secure technology for our digital connections, prioritizing this harmony will require a radical
                    shift in perspective. To enable sustainable growth, scaling up while controlling the planet's
                    resources will necessitate a significant shift in perspective.
                    <br><br>

                    Establishing and preserving human peace and reconciliation, while prioritizing harmony through
                    coexistence, is crucially significant. Accepting differences and learning to live in harmony can
                    account for a faster rate of development and creation of sustainable societies, particularly in
                    developed countries with diverse nationalities.

                    The International Youth Council targets to expose youth from rural and urban societies to advanced

                    Health depicts a human being's wholeness, as a composite of physical, emotional, intellectual,
                    social, and other parts, in which the interdependence of the many parts is acknowledged and accepted.
                    Individual education has been shown to improve mental health, and its impacts are largely moderated
                    by one's employment situation and social support structure. Education promotes physical health on
                    an individual and community level, and its effects are moderated to some extent by economic
                    well-being and two measures of social well-being. This method encourages the formation of
                    relationships based on mutual respect. The three aspects of well-being are interconnected and
                    frequently taught as a unit.

                    is divided into two categories: development and humanitarian aid. Although those expressions appear
                    to be synonymous, they serve distinct functions. Humanitarian assistance aims to prevent and improve
                    preparedness for natural disasters and man-made crises by preserving life, reducing suffering, and
                    preserving human dignity during and after these events. Moreover, humanitarian aid can be guided by
                    the fundamental humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence.
