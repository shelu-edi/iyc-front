                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                    Competence refers to the knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and behaviors that people need to
                    perform a specific task or activity successfully. Exposure to an entrepreneurship program,
                    specifically one that emphasizes both classroom and intensive experience learning, may help an
                    individual to improve his entrepreneurial competencies. These revolve around attitudes (soft skills)
                    including perseverance, networking and self-confidence and enabling skills (hard skills) including
                    basic start up knowledge, business planning, financial literacy and managerial skills.

                    <br><br>

                    When experiencing and conducting practical tasks that support entrepreneurial goals are structured,
                    the younger generation is more advanced in exhibiting certain competencies. Based on the PESTEL
                    analysis, the International Youth Council proposes developing an appropriate framework for future
                    youth generations. Enhancing Entrepreneurial Competence is a key focus area at the International
                    Youth Council because it contributes to the achievement and implementation of the Sustainable
                    Development Goals.

                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                Education is essential for people of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds to achieve success in life. Everyone
                believes, however, that our current educational institutions are inadequate for fulfilling the needs of the twenty-first
                century and that we must repurpose education and reinvent learning organizations. This is due to the rapid acceleration
                of demographic, environmental, economic, social, and technical changes, as well as the associated challenges and
                opportunities. As a result, the International Youth Council works with other global stakeholders to conduct research to
                identify gaps in current educational systems and offer youth the best tools possible to improve their future
                opportunities.

                    Our environment changes as our ways of living, travelling, manufacturing and consuming goods change. This includes
                    everything from the construction of new housing and transportation infrastructure to the construction of waste and water
                    treatment facilities, the transition of technologies in the energy and industrial sectors, and the adoption of more
                    intensive agricultural practices to meet societal needs. Development may result in irreversible environmental damage and
                    serious environmental issues which will compromise the health, safety and quality of living beings.

                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                    A sustainable society has clean air and water, people who live in peace with nature, waste that is recycled to make new
                    products, no usage of fossil fuels, and people who live and work in a linked globe. However, developing this society is
                    a challenging task. To prioritize this harmony, a considerable shift in viewpoint is required, as well as the
                    utilization of clean, renewable resources to replace current energy sources and secure digital technology. To enable
                    sustainable growth, scaling up while controlling the planet's resources would necessitate a fundamental shift in
                    viewpoint.
                    <br><br>
                    Accepting diversity and learning to live in harmony can account for speedier growth and the formation of more
                    sustainable communities, particularly in industrialized nations with a mixed ethnic population. The International Youth
                    Council strives to introduce youth from rural and urban regions to advanced technology, the digitalized environment, and
                    creative technical skills.

                    Health represents the whole of a human person as a composite of physical, emotional, intellectual, social, and other
                    characteristics in which the interdependence of the many elements is acknowledged and supported. Individual education
                    has been demonstrated to boost mental health, while its advantages are usually countered by one's employment
                    circumstances and social support system. Education improves physical health on an individual and societal level, but its
                    benefits are countered to some extent by measures of economic well-being and two indicators of social well-being. This
                    method promotes the formation of respectful relationships. The three happiness attributes are closely related and are
                    typically taught as a set. The IYC, as a youth-focused organization, is in charge of formulating action plans to promote
                    the physical, mental, and social well-being of the entire young population.

                    development and humanitarian relief. Despite the fact that they appear to be interchangeable, they individually serve
                    important functions. Humanitarian help saves lives, alleviates suffering, and protects human dignity during and after
                    natural disasters and man-made crises. Humanitarian concepts such as humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and
                    independence can also be utilized to guide humanitarian aid
